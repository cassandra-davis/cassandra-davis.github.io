    <h3>Tools Used</h3>
    <p>Python, pandas, matplotlib, Power BI</p>

    <h3>About the Project</h3>
    <p>This dashboard was developed to identify fault patterns within test and sensor data, enabling earlier interventions and more reliable system behaviour. The aim was to turn raw datasets into meaningful insights that support engineering decisions.</p>

    <h3>Process</h3>
    <p>The work included cleaning and transforming large datasets, building predictive indicators, and visualising the results through both Python and Power BI. The dashboard was structured to highlight trends, anomalies, and early-warning signs in a clear and actionable way.</p>

    <h3>Deliverables</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Interactive Power BI dashboard</li>
      <li>Python scripts for data ingestion and feature extraction</li>
      <li>Visual reports showing fault likelihood and trends</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Results</h3>
    <p>The solution improved detection of potential issues ahead of time, reducing unplanned downtime and improving reliability across test cycles. Engineers gained clearer visibility into failure patterns, leading to more targeted and efficient investigations.</p>
