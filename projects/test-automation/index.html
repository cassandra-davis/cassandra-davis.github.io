    <h3>Tools Used</h3>
    <p>Python, Excel, PowerPoint automation</p>

    <h3>About the Project</h3>
    <p>The project focused on streamlining the full reporting workflow for automated testing. The goal was to replace manual data collection and formatting with a reliable, consistent system that produces ready‑to‑use summaries and presentations directly from raw data.</p>

    <h3>Process</h3>
    <p>The workflow included parsing test output, cleaning datasets, generating structured Excel summaries, and automatically creating formatted PowerPoint slides. The entire pipeline was built to run with minimal user input, ensuring accuracy and speed.</p>

    <h3>Deliverables</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Automated Excel test summary report</li>
      <li>Auto‑generated PowerPoint presentation with key insights</li>
      <li>Reusable Python scripts for future test cycles</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Results</h3>
    <p>The automation reduced reporting time from several hours to a few minutes per test cycle. It eliminated manual copying errors and ensured consistent formatting across teams. The tool increased overall productivity and allowed engineers to focus on analysis instead of admin.</p>

    <h3>What the Client Said</h3>
    <blockquote>
      <em>“This tool has completely transformed how we report test results. It's fast, consistent, and has already saved us countless hours.”</em>
